Special care should be taken with proteins containing Myb/SANT and ARID domains, since only a subset of proteins containing these domains are DNA-binding transcription factors for specific genes. \nChanged definition see https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/15704\nMerged term see https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/16534"]}, "GO:0006974": {"link": [2933485], "prefLabel": "cellular response to DNA damage stimulus", "synonym": ["response to DNA damage stimulus", "response to genotoxic stress", "cellular DNA damage response", "DNA damage response"], "definition": ["Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus indicating damage to its DNA from environmental insults or errors during metabolism."]}, "GO:0006950": {"link": [2933509], "prefLabel": "response to stress", "synonym": ["response to abiotic stress", "response to biotic stress"], "definition": ["Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a disturbance in organismal or cellular homeostasis, usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation).", "Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation.
