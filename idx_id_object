We hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying these kinetic properties can be approximated by a state diagram in which the transporter has two binding sites, one for sodium and another for chloride and thiazide. On the basis of the state diagram, a system of linear equations that should be satisfied in the steady state was postulated. Numerical solution of these equations yielded model prediction of kinetics of thiazide binding and substrate transport. Rate constants, which determine transitional rates between states, were systematically adjusted to minimize a penalty function that was devised to quantitatively estimate the difference between model predictions and experimental results. With the resultant rate constants, the model could simulate the following experimental results: 1) dissociation constant of thiazide in the absence of sodium and chloride; 2) inhibitory effect of chloride on thiazide binding; 3) stimulatory effect of sodium on thiazide binding; 4) combined effects of sodium and chloride on thiazide binding; 5) dependence of sodium influx on extracellular sodium and chloride; and 6) inhibition of sodium influx by extracellular thiazide. We conclude that known kinetic properties of TSC can be predicted by a model which is based on a state diagram.", "154": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00232-005-0743-x", "155": "renal", "156": "Release

In giant excised inside-out membrane patches from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing rabbit SGLT1, application of a-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (aMDG) to the cytoplasmic solution induced an outward current from cytosolic to external membrane surface. The outward current was Na- and sugar-dependent, and was blocked by phlorizin, a specific inhibitor of SGLT1. The current-voltage relationship saturated at positive membrane voltages (30-50 mV), and approached zero at -150 mV. The half-maximal concentration for aMDG-evoked outward current (K_0.5_aMDG) was 35 mM (at 0 mV). In comparison, K_0.5_aMDG for forward sugar transport was 0.15 mM (at 0 mV). K_0.5_Na was similar for forward and reverse transport (~ 35mM at 0 mV). Specificity of SGLT1 for reverse transport was: aMDG (1.0) > D-galactose (0.84) > 3-O-methyl-glucose (0.55) > D-glucose (0.38), whereas for forward transport, specificity was: aMDG ~ D-glucose ~ D-galactose > 3-O-methylglucose. Thus there is an asymmetry in sugar kinetics and specificity between forward and reverse modes. Computer simulations showed that a 6-state kinetic model for SGLT1 can account for Na/sugar cotransport and its voltage dependence in both the forward and reverse modes at saturating sodium concentrations.

It has long been known that such an osmole source could theoretically contribute to the \"single-effect\" of the urine concentrating mechanism, but there was previously no suggestion of a plausible source. I used numerical simulation to estimate axial gradients of lactate and glucose that might be accumulated by countercurrent recycling in IM vasa recta (IMVR). Based on measurements in other tissues, anaerobic glycolysis (assumed to be independent of diuretic state) was estimated to consume approximately 20% of the glucose delivered to the IM. IM tissue mass and axial distribution of loops and vasa recta were according to reported values for rat and other rodents. Lactate (P(LAC)) and glucose (P(GLU)) permeabilities were varied over a range of plausible values. The model results suggest that P(LAC) of 100 x 10(-5) cm/s (similar to measured permeabilities for other small solutes) is sufficiently high to ensure efficient lactate recycling. By contrast, it was necessary in the model to reduce P(GLU) to a small fraction of this value (1/25th) to avoid papillary glucose depletion by countercurrent shunting. The results predict that IM lactate production could suffice to build a significant steady-state axial lactate gradient in the IM interstitium. Other modeling studies (Jen JF and Stephenson JL. Bull Math Biol 56: 491-514, 1994; and Thomas SR and Wexler AS. Am J Physiol Renal Fluid Electrolyte Physiol 269: F159-F171, 1995) have shown that 20-100 mosmol/kgH(2)O of unspecified external, interstitial, osmolytes could greatly improve IM concentrating ability. The present study gives several plausible scenarios consistent with accumulation of metabolically produced lactate osmoles, although only to the lower end of this range. For example, if 20% of entering glucose is consumed, the model predicts that papillary lactate would attain about 15 mM assuming vasa recta outflow is increased 30% by fluid absorbed from the nephrons and collecting ducts and that this lactate gradient would double if IM blood flow were reduced by one-half, as may occur in antidiuresis.

Using two-microelectrode voltage clamp, we have characterized the presteady-state and steady-state kinetics of SGLT2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The kinetic properties of the steady-state sugar-evoked currents as a function of external Na and a-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (aMG) concentrations were consistent with an ordered, simultaneous transport model in which Na binds first. Na binding was voltage-dependent and saturated with hyperpolarizing voltages. Phlorizin was a potent inhibitor of the sugar-evoked currents (Ki ~10 mM) and blocked an inward Na current in the absence of sugar. SGLT2 exhibited Na-dependent presteadystate currents with time constants 3-7 ms. Charge movements were described by Boltzmann relations with apparent valence ~1 and maximal charge transfer ~11 nC, and were reduced by the addition of sugar or phlorizin. The differences between SGLT1 and SGLT2 were that (i) the apparent affinity constant (K0.5) for aMG (~3 mM) was an order of magnitude higher for SGLT2; (ii) SGLT2 excluded galactose, suggesting discrete sugar binding; (iii) K0.5 for Na was lower in SGLT2; and (iv) the Hill coefficient for Na was 1 for SGLT2 but 2 for SGLT1. Simulations of the six-state kinetic model previously proposed for SGLT1 indicated that many of the kinetic properties observed in SGLT2 are expected by simply reducing the Na/glucose coupling from 2 to 1.", "1511": "The kinetics of calcium binding to the myoplasm buffer troponin -\n            both high and low affinity binding sites.", "1512": "\n            The kinetics of the fCa gate.\n          ", "1513": "\n            The maximum sodium component of the channel's current.\n          ", "1514": "3351", "1515": "rdf:#bab84a90-7d70-4a73-9201-aee97fc3ec08", "1516": "Proportion of inactivating molecules inside of cell", "1517": "Na+ flow across Na diffusive channel", "1518": "G", "1519": "Ca2+", "1520": "Concentration of double proton-bound, antechamber-facing conformation of H-ATPase catalytic component", "1521": "Flux of chloride from tissue fluid to blood capillary (blood in capillary) compartment through capillary", "1522": "sodium concentration in the interstitial fluid and the ascending limb of the loop of Henle", "1523": "Journal of Theoretical Biology", "1524": "Population-based analysis of methadone distribution and metabolism using an age-dependent physiologically based pharmacokinetic model", "1525": "rdf:#b9f14777-1f34-4146-962a-f46ef362b77a", "1526": "Passive systemic arterial pressure component", "1527": "Concentration of Na+ in the cytosol compartment", "1528": "H+ concentration in the cytosolic space", "1529": "Pulmonary venous blood volume", "1530": "#entity_6", "1531": "Concentration of molecule binding with sodium, chloride, and thiazide", "1532": "Pressure in systemic arteries", "1533": "rdf:#faff940e-e1fc-4f3f-b71c-30d9a511ff6e", "1534": "velocity of HCO3- from cytosol to tissue fluid across basolateral membrane", "1535": "Metabolizing Tissue of Organ", "1536": "Binding of ligand to receptor and G-alpha-GDP", "1537": "pressure in the distal tubule (\"at the start of the tubule\" is mentioned in the paper, I assume distal tubule!)", "1538": "A computational model for emergent dynamics in the kidney", "1539": "2000-03-01", "1540": "Cytosolic phosphate(3-) concentration in type-A intercalated cells of late distal tubule", "1541": "#entity_40", "1542": "water in the descending limb of the loop of Henle", "1543": "http://identifiers.org/opb/OPB_01097", "1544": "\n          i_f is a mixed current composed of both Na+ and K+ ions.

Nephron behaviour can fluctuate widely and, under certain conditions, become chaotic. However, the behaviour of the whole kidney remains remarkably stable and blood solute levels are maintained under a wide range of conditions even when many nephrons are damaged or lost. A network model is used to investigate the stability of systems of nephrons and interactions between nephrons. More sophisticated dynamics are explored including the observed oscillations in single nephron filtration rates and the development of stable ionic and osmotic gradients in the inner medulla which contribute to the countercurrent exchange mechanism. We have used the model to explore the effects of changes in input parameters including hydrostatic and osmotic pressures and concentrations of ions, such as sodium and chloride. The intrinsic nephron control, tubuloglomerular feedback, is included and the effects of coupling between nephrons are explored in two-, eight- and 72-nephron models.", "2741": "rdf:#bfec3d24-8fa3-476b-bcf7-fb8a3533c688", "2742": "14480151", "2743": "Reaction R1 flux", "2744": "Anion exchanger", "2745": "Flux of sodium from luminal to cytosol through SGLT1 and apical membrane", "2746": "Potassium component of fast Ca current", "2747": "Maximum current of glucose from cytosol to luminal compartment", "2748": "rdf:#393fb186-60b8-4cf5-9d36-700524a5507e", "2749": "E.M.

Heinz (1978. Mechanics and Engergetics of Biological Transport. Springer-Verlag, Berlin) with the assumption of equilibrium binding and 1:1 stoichiometry. Competitive binding and transport of NH+4 is included within this model. Ion affinities and permeation velocities were selected in a least-squares fit to the kinetic parameters determined experimentally in renal membrane vesicles (Aronson, P.S., M.A. Suhm, and J. Nee. 1983. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 258:6767-6771). The modifier role of internal H+ to enhance transport beyond the expected kinetics (Aronson, P.S., J. Nee, and M. A. Suhm. 1982. Nature. 299:161-163) is represented as a velocity effect of H+ binding to a single site. This kinetic formulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter was incorporated within a model of the rat proximal tubule (Weinstein, A. M. 1994. American Journal of Physiology. 267:F237-F248) as a replacement for the representation by linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics (NET). The membrane density of the antiporter was selected to yield agreement with the rate of tubular Na+ reabsorption. Simulation of 0.5 cm of tubule predicts that the activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter is the most important force for active secretion of ammonia. Model calculations of metabolic acid-base disturbances are performed and comparison is made among antiporter representations (kinetic model, kinetic model without internal modifier, and NET formulation). It is found that the ability to sharply turn off Na+/H+ exchange in cellular alkalosis substantially eliminates the cell volume increase associated with high HCO3- conditions. In the tubule model, diminished Na+/H+ exchange in alkalosis blunts the axial decrease in luminal HCO3- and thus diminishes paracellular reabsorption of Cl-. In this way, the kinetics of the Na+/H+ antiporter could act to enhance distal delivery of Na+, Cl-, and HCO3- in acute metabolic alkalosis.", "3312": "A single-pool inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-receptor-based model for               agonist-stimulated oscillations in Ca 2+ concentration", "3313": "Rapid buffer coeffiecient in the cytoplasm", "3314": "Small coronary arteries chamber pressure", "3315": "W", "3316": "myocyte", "3317": "rdf:#296115a5-a320-4113-9390-7194c208710f", "3318": "K+ flow through basolateral cell membrane and Na-K-ATPase", "3319": "3561", "3320": "Pulmonary valve resistance", "3321": "#effect_of_renal_autoregulatory_feedback_on_EAR_RNAUG4", "3322": "Volume of matrix of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum", "3323": "rdf:#3b81ac65-82e2-4278-9d0c-636e36c3887e", "3324": "rdf:#1ac643bb-53ff-4666-89b0-819cdf84034c", "3325": "Time constant for Ca release", "3326": "http://identifiers.org/cl/CL:0005010", "3327": "Density of PLC-beta bound to calcium (2+) and G-alpha-GTP", "3328": "Concentration of L-type calcium channels at inactivation", "3329": "102", "3330": "Bulk extracellular potassium", "3331": "Total calmodulin concentration in the cytosol", "3332": "Total current through the inward rectifier potassium channel", "3333": "#entity_17", "3334": "Aortic valve resistance", "3335": "Rate constant for internal CNa to external CNa reaction step", "3336": "The monoexponential activation rate seen in caged calcium (2+) experiments.
