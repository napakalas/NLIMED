We hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying these kinetic properties can be approximated by a state diagram in which the transporter has two binding sites, one for sodium and another for chloride and thiazide. On the basis of the state diagram, a system of linear equations that should be satisfied in the steady state was postulated. Numerical solution of these equations yielded model prediction of kinetics of thiazide binding and substrate transport. Rate constants, which determine transitional rates between states, were systematically adjusted to minimize a penalty function that was devised to quantitatively estimate the difference between model predictions and experimental results. With the resultant rate constants, the model could simulate the following experimental results: 1) dissociation constant of thiazide in the absence of sodium and chloride; 2) inhibitory effect of chloride on thiazide binding; 3) stimulatory effect of sodium on thiazide binding; 4) combined effects of sodium and chloride on thiazide binding; 5) dependence of sodium influx on extracellular sodium and chloride; and 6) inhibition of sodium influx by extracellular thiazide.

The half-maximal concentration for aMDG-evoked outward current (K_0.5_aMDG) was 35 mM (at 0 mV). In comparison, K_0.5_aMDG for forward sugar transport was 0.15 mM (at 0 mV). K_0.5_Na was similar for forward and reverse transport (~ 35mM at 0 mV). Specificity of SGLT1 for reverse transport was: aMDG (1.0) > D-galactose (0.84) > 3-O-methyl-glucose (0.55) > D-glucose (0.38), whereas for forward transport, specificity was: aMDG ~ D-glucose ~ D-galactose > 3-O-methylglucose. Thus there is an asymmetry in sugar kinetics and specificity between forward and reverse modes. Computer simulations showed that a 6-state kinetic model for SGLT1 can account for Na/sugar cotransport and its voltage dependence in both the forward and reverse modes at saturating sodium concentrations. Our data indicate that under physiological conditions, the transporter is poised to accumulate sugar efficiently in the enterocyte.", "1767": "Forward rate constant for proton binding to the proton-bound, antechamber-facing conformation of H-ATPase catalytic component", "1768": "Backward rate constant for proton binding to antechamber-facing conformation of H-ATPase catalytic component", "1769": "Steady state external Na bound cotransporter concentration", "1770": "Pre-steady state internal unbound cotransporter concentration", "1771": "Adult rat Epicardial/endocardial left ventriculat cell", "1772": "http://identifiers.org/chebi/CHEBI:50220", "1773": "1999-05-11", "1774": "NH4+-loaded Na-H exchanger extracellular side", "1775": "http://identifiers.org/fma/FMA:62333", "1776": "Ca2+ feedback on the production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) is described by the equation below, where alpha has a value between 0 and 1.", "1777": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_67498", "1778": "Vena cava end systolic elastance", "1779": "http://identifiers.org/chebi/CHEBI:29239", "1780": "http://identifiers.org/fma/FMA:17721", "1781": "Half saturation of sarcolemmal pump", "1782": "K", "1783": "Neuronal metabolism of ATPase (excluding Na-ATPase)", "1784": "Septal wall end diastolic pressure", "1785": "Current through the transient outward potassium channel", "1786": "inorganic phosphate", "1787": "1239", "1788": "Proximal pulmonary arterial volume", "1789": "Intercellular cleft", "1790": "Calculation the net free energy of the cycle.", "1791": "Simple Cardiovascular Model", "1792": "concentration of Ca2+ in the portion of cytosol in epithelial cell of trachea compartment", "1793": "Made 2 new variables - dCaCalmoddt and dCaTropdt in component \"intracellular_calcium_concentration,\" equated these variables to d(CaCalmod)/d(time) and d(CaTrop)/d(time), respectively.

Using two-microelectrode voltage clamp, we have characterized the presteady-state and steady-state kinetics of SGLT2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The kinetic properties of the steady-state sugar-evoked currents as a function of external Na and a-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (aMG) concentrations were consistent with an ordered, simultaneous transport model in which Na binds first. Na binding was voltage-dependent and saturated with hyperpolarizing voltages. Phlorizin was a potent inhibitor of the sugar-evoked currents (Ki ~10 mM) and blocked an inward Na current in the absence of sugar. SGLT2 exhibited Na-dependent presteadystate currents with time constants 3-7 ms. Charge movements were described by Boltzmann relations with apparent valence ~1 and maximal charge transfer ~11 nC, and were reduced by the addition of sugar or phlorizin. The differences between SGLT1 and SGLT2 were that (i) the apparent affinity constant (K0.5) for aMG (~3 mM) was an order of magnitude higher for SGLT2; (ii) SGLT2 excluded galactose, suggesting discrete sugar binding; (iii) K0.5 for Na was lower in SGLT2; and (iv) the Hill coefficient for Na was 1 for SGLT2 but 2 for SGLT1. Simulations of the six-state kinetic model previously proposed for SGLT1 indicated that many of the kinetic properties observed in SGLT2 are expected by simply reducing the Na/glucose coupling from 2 to 1.", "2068": "O", "2069": "State 3 of calcium release unit: z3 = yic union yio", "2070": "inactive signalling enzyme 5", "2071": "Hyperpolarization activated channel potassium current", "2072": "http://identifiers.org/fma/FMA:83365", "2073": "penny.noble@physiol.ox.ac.uk", "2074": "Large coronary arteries flow", "2075": "Inner medullary lactate production and accumulation: a vasa recta model", "2076": "Concentration of adaptor heterodimer", "2077": "Flux of K+ from portion of renal filtrate in distal convoluted tubule compartment to portion of tissue fluid in epithelial cell of distal tubule compartment across K diffusive channel", "2078": "Length at which the series elastic component force-elongation relation changes from exponential to linear", "2079": "Rate constant for internal CNaS to external CNaS reaction step", "2080": "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0005962", "2081": "flux of volume (blood) reabsorption into the ascending vasa recta from long descending Henle?s loop (LDL) and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD)", "2082": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0004535", "2083": "Flux through calcium uniporters", "2084": "TOSHIRO FUJITA", "2085": "Concentration of nonfunctional second enzyme", "2086": "Calcium concentration in the network regions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum", "2087": "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0015276", "2088": "Ca receptor binding constant (inhibition)", "2089": "Minimum elastance left atrium", "2090": "Sodium equilibrium potential", "2091": "Concentration of active signaling enzyme 5", "2092": "Proportion of activating molecules inside of cell", "2093": "Right ventricular blood pressure", "2094": "Calculate some volume fractions as proportions of the total\n            myoplasmic volume.", "2095": "https://identifiers.org/chebi/CHEBI:88003", "2096": "2004-09-00 00:00", "2097": "JHatp", "2098": "Curve-shaping parameter that sets the length of the force-length plateau", "2099": "Time - Solution domain", "2100": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_14069", "2101": "143", "2102": "Flux of K+ from luminal compartment to tissue fluid compartment through paracellular pathway and K diffusive channel", "2103": "HCO3- flow across basolateral membrane", "2104": "Unstressed end-diastolic left atrium volume", "2105": "Concentration of molecule binding with sodium, chloride, and thiazide", "2106": "The JWR model creates a new mathematical model to describe the\n            L-type calcium channel that is based on the experimentally observed\n            mode-switching behaviour of the channel.

However, the behaviour of the whole kidney remains remarkably stable and blood solute levels are maintained under a wide range of conditions even when many nephrons are damaged or lost. A network model is used to investigate the stability of systems of nephrons and interactions between nephrons. More sophisticated dynamics are explored including the observed oscillations in single nephron filtration rates and the development of stable ionic and osmotic gradients in the inner medulla which contribute to the countercurrent exchange mechanism. We have used the model to explore the effects of changes in input parameters including hydrostatic and osmotic pressures and concentrations of ions, such as sodium and chloride.

It has long been known that such an osmole source could theoretically contribute to the \"single-effect\" of the urine concentrating mechanism, but there was previously no suggestion of a plausible source. I used numerical simulation to estimate axial gradients of lactate and glucose that might be accumulated by countercurrent recycling in IM vasa recta (IMVR). Based on measurements in other tissues, anaerobic glycolysis (assumed to be independent of diuretic state) was estimated to consume approximately 20% of the glucose delivered to the IM. IM tissue mass and axial distribution of loops and vasa recta were according to reported values for rat and other rodents. Lactate (P(LAC)) and glucose (P(GLU)) permeabilities were varied over a range of plausible values. The model results suggest that P(LAC) of 100 x 10(-5) cm/s (similar to measured permeabilities for other small solutes) is sufficiently high to ensure efficient lactate recycling. By contrast, it was necessary in the model to reduce P(GLU) to a small fraction of this value (1/25th) to avoid papillary glucose depletion by countercurrent shunting. The results predict that IM lactate production could suffice to build a significant steady-state axial lactate gradient in the IM interstitium. Other modeling studies (Jen JF and Stephenson JL. Bull Math Biol 56: 491-514, 1994; and Thomas SR and Wexler AS. Am J Physiol Renal Fluid Electrolyte Physiol 269: F159-F171, 1995) have shown that 20-100 mosmol/kgH(2)O of unspecified external, interstitial, osmolytes could greatly improve IM concentrating ability. The present study gives several plausible scenarios consistent with accumulation of metabolically produced lactate osmoles, although only to the lower end of this range. For example, if 20% of entering glucose is consumed, the model predicts that papillary lactate would attain about 15 mM assuming vasa recta outflow is increased 30% by fluid absorbed from the nephrons and collecting ducts and that this lactate gradient would double if IM blood flow were reduced by one-half, as may occur in antidiuresis.

Heinz (1978. Mechanics and Engergetics of Biological Transport. Springer-Verlag, Berlin) with the assumption of equilibrium binding and 1:1 stoichiometry. Competitive binding and transport of NH+4 is included within this model. Ion affinities and permeation velocities were selected in a least-squares fit to the kinetic parameters determined experimentally in renal membrane vesicles (Aronson, P.S., M.A. Suhm, and J. Nee. 1983. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 258:6767-6771). The modifier role of internal H+ to enhance transport beyond the expected kinetics (Aronson, P.S., J. Nee, and M. A. Suhm. 1982. Nature. 299:161-163) is represented as a velocity effect of H+ binding to a single site. This kinetic formulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter was incorporated within a model of the rat proximal tubule (Weinstein, A. M. 1994. American Journal of Physiology. 267:F237-F248) as a replacement for the representation by linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics (NET). The membrane density of the antiporter was selected to yield agreement with the rate of tubular Na+ reabsorption. Simulation of 0.5 cm of tubule predicts that the activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter is the most important force for active secretion of ammonia. Model calculations of metabolic acid-base disturbances are performed and comparison is made among antiporter representations (kinetic model, kinetic model without internal modifier, and NET formulation). It is found that the ability to sharply turn off Na+/H+ exchange in cellular alkalosis substantially eliminates the cell volume increase associated with high HCO3- conditions. In the tubule model, diminished Na+/H+ exchange in alkalosis blunts the axial decrease in luminal HCO3- and thus diminishes paracellular reabsorption of Cl-. In this way, the kinetics of the Na+/H+ antiporter could act to enhance distal delivery of Na+, Cl-, and HCO3- in acute metabolic alkalosis.", "3282": "transitional rate of dissociation Cl- from state ECl to state E on the luminal compartment", "3283": "\n            The kinetics of the m gate.\n          ", "3284": "Steady-state outward potassium channel current", "3285": "Distal aorta transmural pressure", "3286": "water and mineral metabolism", "3287": "Voltage gated delayed rectifier potassium current", "3288": "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0006651", "3289": "The kinetics of the h gate.", "3290": "\n          added metadata\n        ", "3291": "http://identifiers.org/chebi/CHEBI:37154", "3292": "0.215969749518694", "3293": "Na+ - Ca2+ current exchanger across sarcolemma", "3294": "Toshiro Fujita", "3295": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PR_Q9JI66", "3296": "H gate sodium ion transfer constant (out to in)", "3297": "Inward Na current", "3298": "Ca release from sarcoplasmic reticulum into cytosol of cardiac myocyte", "3299": "In this model, the formation of troponin C comes from the dissociation of the calcium (2+) / troponin C complex", "3300": "Small coronary arteries", "3301": "Na-glucose pre-steady state current", "3302": "http://identifiers.org/fma/FMA:70022", "3303": "NHE3-baso", "3304": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_62343", "3305": "Nokes", "3306": "Fully activated value of delayed K current", "3307": "Intercellular coupling permeability rate constant.", "3308": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_279935", "3309": "Heart Rate", "3310": "\n            The opening rate for the K1 gate.\n          ", "3311": "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0006102", "3312": "Distal pulmonary arterial chamber pressure", "3313": "Concentration of cyclic AMP", "3314": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PR_P53790", "3315": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000786", "3316": "Yang et al.'s age-dependent, physiologically based pharmokinetic model of methadone distribution and metabolism.", "3317": "Hyperpolarizing activated K channel current", "3318": "The fraction of actin sites available for crossbridge binding as determined by thin filament kinetics", "3319": "Left ventricular free wall volume at end zero pressure", "3320": "Concentration of phosphate in the cytosol", "3321": "2000-07", "3322": "k_23 is the rate of transition from state 2 to 3 in the luminal compartment", "3323": "transitional rate of binding Na_ ion from state E_ to state ENa_ on the intracellular compartment", "3324": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_24996", "3325": "Maximum luminal volume of systemic arteries", "3326": "Large coronary arteries resistance", "3327": "Calcium flux through the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA2a)", "3328": "Phosphofructokinase metabolism in the astrocyte", "3329": "mitochondrial inner membrane potential", "3330": "Ca concentration in the muscle bath", "3331": "Density of functional SGLT2 carriers in the oocyte membrane", "3332": "BioSystems", "3333": "The Noble98 (Noble et al. 1998) model of the guinea-pig ventricular cell was a development of the Noble91 (Noble et al. 1991) model and included representation of the components of IK, (IKr and IKs), the persistent sodium current and a dyadic space between the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Transport rates were calculated using kinetic equations. Axial heterogeneity was represented by partitioning the model into two subsegments with different sets of model parameters. Model equations derived from the principles of mass conservation and electrical neutrality were solved numerically. Values of the model parameters were adjusted to minimize a penalty function that was devised to quantify the difference between model predictions and experimental results. The developed model could simulate the water and solute transport of the distal tubule in the normal state, as well as in conditions including thiazide or amiloride application and various levels of sodium load and tubular flow rate.", "3666": "Sodium pump from neuron to the extracellular space.", "3667": "http://identifiers.org/chebi/CHEBI:16908", "3668": "Cloride ion flux across astrocytic membrane.", "3669": "Concentration of deactivating enzyme P4", "3670": "Concentration of chloride in the portion of renal filtrate in distal convoluted tubule compartment", "3671": "Computational modeling of cardiovascular response to orthostatic stress", "3672": "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0014701", "3673": "water in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle", "3674": "calcium flux out of the mitochondria into the cytosol through the sodium-calcium ion exchanger", "3675": "Fraction of muscle length", "3676": "Saleet", "3677": "The following equation calculates the reversal potential of the\n            time-independent potassium current.", "3678": "Plasma membrane charge capacity", "3679": "This model has been curated by Penny Noble of Oxford University and is known to run in PCEnv and COR and reproduce the results published in the paper it is based on.", "3680": "concentration of biocarbonate in the portion of cytoosl in epithelial cell of collecting duct of renal tubule compartment", "3681": "Na+ flow through apical plasma membrane", "3682": "concentration of bicarbonate in the extracellular space (ECS) compartment", "3683": "Non-driving ECG curve", "3684": "2008-00-00 00:00", "3685": "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0051480", "3686": "Permeability of a single L-type calcium channel", "3687": "active transport", "3688": "Initial contribution of muscle elastic elements to fraction of muscle length", "3689": "http://identifiers.org/chebi/CHEBI:24996", "3690": "concentration of TSC molecule binding with sodium on the luminal compartment", "3691": "Volume of cytsol on cardiac myocyte", "3692": "0.8375", "3693": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PR_000015207", "3694": "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0005227", "3695": "1952-01-01", "3696": "Reaction R9 flux", "3697": "http://identifiers.org/opb/OPB_00509", "3698": "1952-00-00 00:00", "3699": "Background calcium channel current", "3700": "The main component of the model which defines the action potential.", "3701": "http://identifiers.org/opb/OPB_00378", "3702": "Fast sodium channel current across plasma membrane", "3703": "Calcium flux from mitochondria to the cytosol", "3704": "concentration of Ca2+ in the portion of extracellular matrix in epithelial cell of trachea compartment", "3705": "Calculation of the dimless_MgATP parameter.", "3706": "Jonna", "3707": "Reaction R12 flux", "3708": "Volume of the matrix of the network sarcoplasmic reticulum", "3709": "Blood flow through atrial valve", "3710": "The fraction of actin sites available for crossbridge binding", "3711": "Pericardial P-V curve parameter", "3712": "Flux of sodium from luminal to tissue fluid compartment through Na diffusive channel and paracellular pathway", "3713": "The force at which the ascending limb changes slope", "3714": "transition complex between an inactive substate and its activator (4)", "3715": "133", "3716": "http://identifiers.org/chebi/CHEBI:29995", "3717": "Cytosolic volume", "3718": "Isometric tension produced by crossbridges in the cardiac muscle.", "3719": "Rate of change in the number of potassium ions in the extracellular space.", "3720": "deactivating enzyme 3", "3721": "Jeremy", "3722": "Cell 1 Ca concentration in the cytoplasm", "3723": "http://identifiers.org/opb/OPB_01097", "3724": "Relationship between membrane voltage and F*R/T.", "3725": "Sodium exchange from astrocyte to the extracellular space.", "3726": "Maximum rate of IP3 production.", "3727": "anion exchanger intracellular side", "3728": "Current through the inward rectifier potassium channel", "3729": "Shannon", "3730": "Potassium ion equilibrium potential", "3731": "Chang and Fujita's 2001 mathematical model of an anion exchanger in the \n        distal tubule of the rat: it is one component of an overall model of \n        acid/base transport in a distal tubule.", "3732": "Concentration of glucose in the cytosol compartment", "3733": "Constant for rate equation represented by phi 3", "3734": "Dissociation constant for the binding of unbound receptor to G-protein", "3735": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_7096", "3736": "number of descending vasa recta (DVR) at depth x in the inner medullary vasa recta model", "3737": "Calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum", "3738": "Right Ventricular Freewall Diastolic Exponential Parameter"}
