# NLIMED Experiment

This experiment is also available at google [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xq3ewKIT9pHD0AveWuYy2cpJvG4oLjDR). However, since the experiment tents to create a large amount of data and take several hours, so if you do not have a pro account, it is better to run locally.
